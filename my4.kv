# Filename: main.kv

# here we need to add the kivy version first.
# first we have to reference MyGrid class here.
# if we had multiple windows, then we have to reference different classes.
# so we can use a tag which means we will work on MyGrid class.
<MyGrid_past>:
    # here the <MyGrid_past> is called the parent tag
    # this exactly works as python indentation
    Label:
    # we will use Label class
        text:"Hello World!"
        # and we will pass text param

# we can see that the widgets are at the left-corner,
# instead of being in the middle. 
# because these are a widgets and thse widgets have some default size and position.
# so, we have to overwrite that properties
# For this module, lets create our previous form.
<MyGrid>:
    GridLayout:
        cols: 1
        # Now if we want to place the form in the middle of the screen,
        # we need to define more properties.
        # we can use few propertieslike position, size etc.

        # changing size
        size: root.width, root.height
        # here root widget is going to be MyGrid()
        # and MyGrid have some default height and width which is the entire window.
        # we can actually change the size by,
        size: root.width-200, root.height-200

        # changing the position,
        pos: 100, 100
        # this is the left padding and bottom padding

        GridLayout:
            cols: 2
        
            Label: 
                text: "Name: "
            TextInput:
                multiline: False

            Label: 
                text: "Email: "
            TextInput:
                multiline: False

            Label: 
                text: "Message: "
            TextInput:
